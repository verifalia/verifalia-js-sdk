     * Initializes a new HTTPS-based REST client for Verifalia with the specified configuration.
     *
     * This constructor accepts either the user-name and password credentials of your root
     * Verifalia account, those of a Verifalia user (previously known as sub-accounts) or a Verifalia
     * browser app's key. As an alternative to the above, it is also possible to specify an X.509
     * client certificate for mutual TLS client authentication (only available in Node.js).
     *
     * For security reasons, it is always advisable to create and use a dedicated user for accessing
     * the Verifalia API, as doing so will allow to assign only the specific needed permissions to it.
     *
     * Here is how to create an instance of this class with a user-name and password pair:
     * ```ts
     * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient({
     *   username: 'johndoe',
     *   password: 'mysecretpa$$word'
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * To use a browser app, pass its app key through the `username` field:
     * ```ts
     * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient({
     *   username: '0a0321de08f54d3caff43951311bf958'
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * To authenticate using an X.509 client certificate (only available in Node.js), specify its public
     * key using the `cert` field and its private key with the `key` field:
     * ```ts
     * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient({
     *   cert: fs.readFileSync('/home/rmontagnani/my-client-certificate.pem'),
     *   key: fs.readFileSync('/home/rmontagnani/my-client-certificate.key')
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * @param config Contains the configuration for the Verifalia API client, including the credentials
     * to use while authenticating to the Verifalia service.
     */
