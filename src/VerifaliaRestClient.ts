/**
 * HTTPS-based REST client for Verifalia. This is the starting point to every other operation against
 * the Verifalia API, it allows to easily validate email addresses, manage submitted email validation
 * jobs and operate on the credits of the account.
 * 
 * To submit and manage email validations, use the methods exposed by the `emailValidations` field.
 * To manage the credits for the Verifalia account, use the methods exposed by the `credits` field.
 * 
 * This class constructor accepts the credentials of your root Verifalia account or of one of its users
 * (previously known as sub-accounts): if you don't have a Verifalia account, just register for a free
 * one at https://verifalia.com/sign-up/free. For security reasons, it is always advisable to create
 * and use a dedicated user for accessing the API, as doing so will allow to assign only the specific
 * needed permissions to it.
 * 
 * Here is how to create an instance of this class:
 * ```ts
 * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient({
 *   username: 'johndoe',
 *   password: 'mysecretpa$$word'
 * });
 * ```
