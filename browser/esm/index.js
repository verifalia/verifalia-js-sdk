     * Submits one or more email addresses for validation. By default, this method does not wait for
     * the completion of the email validation job: pass a `WaitingStrategy` (or `true`, to wait
     * until the job is completed) to request a different waiting behavior.
     * This method accepts a wide range of input types, including:
     * - `string` and `string[]`
     * - `ValidationRequestEntry` and `ValidationRequestEntry[]`
     * - `ValidationRequest`
     * - `FileValidationRequest`
     *
     * Here is the simplest case, showing how to validate one email address:
     * ```ts
     * // Option 1 - async/await
     *
     * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient(...);
     * const result = await verifalia
     *     .emailValidations
     *     .submit('batman@gmail.com', true);

     * // Option 2 - callback
     *
     * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient(...);
     * verifalia

     *         console.log(result.entries[0].classification); // 'Deliverable'
     *     });
     * ```
     *
     * To validate multiple email addresses at once, just submit an array of strings:
     * ```ts
     * // Option 1 - async/await
     *
     * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient(...);
     * const result = await verifalia
     *     .emailValidations
     *     .submit([ 'batman@gmail.com', 'robin1940@yahoo.com' ], true);
     *
     * result.entries.forEach((item) => {
     *     console.log(`${item.inputData}: ${item.classification}`);
     * }); // 'batman@gmail.com: Deliverable' 'robin1940@yahoo.com: Undeliverable'
     *
     * // Option 2 - callback
     *
     * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient(...);
     * verifalia
     *     .emailValidations
     *     .submit([ 'batman@gmail.com', 'robin1940@yahoo.com' ], true);
     *     .then(result => {

     * ```ts
     * const verifalia = new VerifaliaRestClient({
